All of our code is currently run using python and sklearn and is stored in the jupyter notebook. 

To compile and run our code please install jupyter and launch the notebook within the repository. You should be redirected to a browser with the directory opened in the notebook. If you experience any issues please refer to the jupyter documentation.

From there you may open our notebook and run code by section using the ctrl-enter or cmd-enter shortcut. Everything may be run from top to bottom in order for compilation. You do have the option of using different cutoffs for the data to use one or the other simply run the one you wish to use last. As for the PCA option, it is not yet tuned to the dataset and as a result does not output useful data.
